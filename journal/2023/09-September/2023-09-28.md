## Bootstrap Refresher

I learned about Bootstrap in one of Angela's other courses, but I'm doing a quick refresher today.

I first did some practice with the 12-column system [here](https://appbrewery.github.io/bootstrap-layout/). Something about this clicks a little better now, I don't know if I did this exercise before.

Using the [examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/) page to cobble together various elements of a website to quickly get started seems smart, especially if I'm not so focused on doing webdesign but backend stuff.

I just realized today you can also hide regions of your HTML code in VS Code - this will make scrolling much less of a pain.

Maybe it's silly but I just realized today also how much easier it is to read your HTML if you have a comment heading for every section - it allows you to hide that section and quickly browse to the element you want to edit.

```html
<!-- Title -->
<div>Minimized HTML for Title</div>
<!-- Carousel -->
<div>Minimized HTML for Carousel</div>
<!-- Footer -->
<div>Minimized HTML for Footer</div>
```

One frustrating thing about the Bootstrap docs is that you can maybe not realize you're reading an outdated version, and it doesn't say that there's a newer version availabe in the dropdown menu. I need to stop googling for the BS docs just find the latest one every time from their website directly.

In 5.3, [you can easily enable dark mode](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/color-modes/#enable-dark-mode).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" data-bs-theme="dark">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
        <title>Bootstrap demo</title>
        <link
            href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
            rel="stylesheet"
            integrity="sha384-T3c6CoIi6uLrA9TneNEoa7RxnatzjcDSCmG1MXxSR1GAsXEV/Dwwykc2MPK8M2HN"
            crossorigin="anonymous"
        />
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <script
            src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
            integrity="sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL"
            crossorigin="anonymous"
        ></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

I'm going to skip doing the tindog project since I already did that before in an earlier version of Bootstrap. I want to focus on backend stuff anyway, and I get Bootstrap much more this second time through.
