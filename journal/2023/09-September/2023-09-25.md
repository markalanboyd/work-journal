## cookie-clicker-bot insights

The [cookie-clicker-bot](https://github.com/markalanboyd/cookie-clicker-bot) I'm working on has helped me understand a lot about how to break a more complex script up into multiple files.

### Configuration Module vs. Singleton

I ran into a problem when trying to pass around a config file between multiple scripts. This config file contains the paths that Selenium uses to look for each element on the Cookie Clicker game page.

I asked ChatGPT its opinion on how to do this, and it suggested two solutions: a central configuration module or a singleton.

A config module works like this:

##### config_loader.py

```python
import json

def load_config(config_path="config.json"):
    with open(config_path, "r") as file:
        return json.load(file)

CONFIG = load_config()
```

##### main.py

```python
from config_loader import CONFIG

some_value = CONFIG["some_key"]
```

You create a global constant `CONFIG` and load the data into it. You then import that constant into whatever file needs to use it.

Even though you could be importing the `CONFIG` constant into multiple files, it won't create multiple objects in memory. It will simply point to the object it already created when it loaded it the first time.

A singleton, on the other hand works by creating a class that has one function, which is to encapsulate some data and pass it on to other scripts that call on it.

##### config_singleton.py

```python
import json

class ConfigSingleton:
    _instance = None
    _config = None

    def __new__(cls, config_path="config.json"):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(ConfigSingleton, cls).__new__(cls)
            with open(config_path, "r") as file:
                cls._config = json.load(file)
        return cls._instance

    @property
    def config(self):
        return self._config
```

##### main.py

```python
from config_singleton import ConfigSingleton

config = ConfigSingleton().config
```

This method is a bit more complex and I will explain it in depth.

```python
class ConfigSingleton:
    _instance = None
    _config = None
```

First we need to declare two protected variables, one for `_instance` and the other for `_config`. The `_instance` variable holds the instance of the class we'll be creating, and the `_config` holds the config file that we'll be loading.

```python
def __new__(cls, config_path="config.json"):
```

The `__new__` dunder method creates and returns a new instance of a class. The first argument of `__new__` methods are always `cls` which stands for class. In this case, it is also taking another argument of the `config_path` to the json file.

```python
if cls._instance is None:
```

Here we check if the `cls._instance` variable from the class is `None`, in which case we proceed with the rest of the code that loads the config file. If it is not `None` however, that means the class has already been instantiated somewhere and it skips loading the config file again. This way you prevent creating a new instance of the class every time you call it, unnecessarily eating up memory.

```python
cls._instance = super(ConfigSingleton, cls).__new__(cls)
```

This line is a little mindbending and it took me a while to understand it, but it's why this whole thing works. The `super(ConfigSingleton, cls)` returns a temporary object of the superclass, which is in this case the class itself. It assigns the attribute of `__new__(cls)` to the `cls._instance` variable, which is the `ConfigSingleton` class.

```python
    with open(config_path, "r") as file:
        cls._config = json.load(file)
return cls._instance
```

The function then of course opens and reads the config file and assigns it to the `cls._config` variable, which is held within the class instance. Finally it returns the instance, which encapsulates the config file.

```python
@property
def config(self):
    return self._config
```

The `@property` decorator acts as a getter for a class attribute. The attribute we're interested in is the config file, so all the function does is return this variable when called.

```python
from config_singleton import ConfigSingleton

config = ConfigSingleton().config
```

Finally, in the `main.py` file or wherever else you want to use this config file, all you need to do is import the `ConfigSingleton` class, instantiate it, and assign its `.config` property to a variable within the script you want to use it.

If you instantiate this class multiple times throughout your project, it will never run the internal script again and waste memory by creating a new duplicate object because the `cls._instance` is no longer `None` after it's been called the first time.

So why go through all this trouble to do a singleton when a config module does the same in fewer lines and is more Pythonic?

A singleton prevents namespace overlap so that you don't accidentally use the same global variable somewhere else for something else. However, this largely applies to big projects where the chances of that happening increase.

After doing all this to understand the approaches of each, I decided I should probably rewrite the code to use the config module instead. For a simple project like this, a singleton is just overkill - even though learning about them was a great way to spend the morning.

## Intro to Flask

I started learning about Flask today which along with Django are two frameworks used with Python to manage the backend of websites.

### Decorators

In the `Hello World!` example for Flask, we have a decorator:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/") # This one right here
def hello_world():
    return "<p>Hello, World!</p>"
```

We had a decorator in the singleton that allowed us to pass the config file out of the class without altering the internal config variable. In this case however, we're using a decorator to add functionalty to another function. Here's an example:

```python
@decorator_name
def your_function():
    pass
```

This is just syntatic sugar (that is, a nicer way of writing):

```python
your_function = decorator_name(your_function)
```

In practice, you can use decorators on functions to add functionality before or after the function is called.

##### Decorator script example

```python
def simple_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@simple_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

##### Output

```shell
Something is happening before the function is called.
Hello!
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

By adding the `@simple_decorator` to any other function (not just the `say_hello()` one you see there) you can add this extra functionality.

Returning to the Flask code:

```python
@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    return "<p>Hello, World!</p>"
```

This means that the app will only trigger the function that follows it when the route or path in the URL is `"/"`, essentially the home page.

The Flask framework determines when it's appropriate to call which function depending on where you're navigating to.

```python
@app.route("/bye")
def goodbye_world():
    return "<p>Goodbye cruel world!</p>"
```

This code would then only trigger when navigating to the `"/bye"` page.

### Variables in Flask

If you want to add variables to routes, you do it like this:

```python
@app.route("/username/<name>")
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello {name}!"
```

When you type in the browser `http://127.0.0.1:5000/username/Mark`, you'll see a page that says `"Hello Mark!"`

If you make changes to the code, you have to restart your server unless you have the debug mode turned on, like this:

```python
app.run(debug=True)
```

Now when you save the file it will automatically restart the server with your changes. Not only that, but if you make a mistake, it gives you a nicely formatted error page.

You can also tap into a web-based CLI using a pincode you get in your computer's CLI that looks like 3 random 3 digit numbers `259-465-116`.

Other helpful ways of working with variables:

-   You can add paths after a variable.

    ```python
    @app.route("/username/<name>/1")
    ```

-   Converters can manipulate the variable in various ways. This one returns the whole path after the `username/` as the variable `name`

    ```python
    @app.route("/username/<path:name>")
    ```

-   You can also have several variables like so:

    ```python
    @app.route("/username/<name>/<int:number>")
    def greet(name, number):
        return f"Hello {name}! You are {number} years old!"
    ```

### Loading HTML pages with pathlib

I found a nice way to load an html doc as text in a one-liner using the pathlib `Path` method:

```python
from flask import Flask
from pathlib import Path

app = Flask(__name__)
index_page = Path("index.html").read_text()


@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    return index_page


app.run(debug=True)
```

This is just a little faster than the `with open()` method.
