The [cookie-clicker-bot](https://github.com/markalanboyd/cookie-clicker-bot) I'm working on has helped me understand a lot about how to break a more complex script up into multiple files.

### Configuration Module vs. Singleton

I ran into a problem when trying to pass around a config file between multiple scripts. This config file contains the paths that Selenium uses to look for each element on the Cookie Clicker game page.

I asked ChatGPT its opinion on how to do this, and it suggested two solutions: a central configuration module or a singleton.

A config module works like this:

##### config_loader.py

```python
import json

def load_config(config_path="config.json"):
    with open(config_path, "r") as file:
        return json.load(file)

CONFIG = load_config()
```

##### main.py

```python
from config_loader import CONFIG

# Accessing a value
some_value = CONFIG["some_key"]
```

You create a global constant `CONFIG` and load the data into it. You then import that constant into whatever file needs to use it.

Even though you could be importing the `CONFIG` constant into multiple files, it won't create multiple objects in memory. It will simply point to the object it already created when it loaded it the first time.

A singleton, on the other hand works by creating a class that has one function, which is to encapsulate some data and pass it on to other scripts that call on it.

##### config_singleton.py

```python
import json

class ConfigSingleton:
    _instance = None
    _config = None

    def __new__(cls, config_path="config.json"):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(ConfigSingleton, cls).__new__(cls)
            with open(config_path, "r") as file:
                cls._config = json.load(file)
        return cls._instance

    @property
    def config(self):
        return self._config
```

##### main.py

```python
from config_singleton import ConfigSingleton

config = ConfigSingleton().config
```

This method is a bit more complex and I will explain it in depth.

```python
class ConfigSingleton:
    _instance = None
    _config = None
```

First we need to declare two protected variables, one for `_instance` and the other for `_config`. The `_instance` variable holds the instance of the class we'll be creating, and the `_config` holds the config file that we'll be loading.

```python
def __new__(cls, config_path="config.json"):
```

The `__new__` dunder method creates and returns a new instance of a class. The first argument of `__new__` methods are always `cls` which stands for class. In this case, it is also taking another argument of the `config_path` to the json file.

```python
if cls._instance is None:
```

Here we check if the `cls._instance` variable from the class is `None`, in which case we proceed with the rest of the code that loads the config file. If it is not `None` however, that means the class has already been instantiated somewhere and it skips loading the config file again. This way you prevent creating a new instance of the class every time you call it, unnecessarily eating up memory.

```python
cls._instance = super(ConfigSingleton, cls).__new__(cls)
```

This line is a little mindbending and it took me a while to understand it, but it's why this whole thing works. The `super(ConfigSingleton, cls)` returns a temporary object of the superclass, which is in this case the class itself. It assigns the attribute of `__new__(cls)` to the `cls._instance` variable, which is the `ConfigSingleton` class.

```python
    with open(config_path, "r") as file:
        cls._config = json.load(file)
return cls._instance
```

The function then of course opens and reads the config file and assigns it to the `cls._config` variable, which is held within the class instance. Finally it returns the instance, which encapsulates the config file.

```python
@property
def config(self):
    return self._config
```

The `@property` decorator acts as a getter for a class attribute. The attribute we're interested in is the config file, so all the function does is return this variable when called.

```python
from config_singleton import ConfigSingleton

config = ConfigSingleton().config
```

Finally, in the `main.py` file or wherever else you want to use this config file, all you need to do is import the `ConfigSingleton` class, instantiate it, and assign its `.config` property to a variable within the script you want to use it.

If you instantiate this class multiple times throughout your project, it will never run the internal script again and waste memory by creating a new duplicate object because the `cls._instance` is no longer `None` after it's been called the first time.

So why go through all this trouble to do a singleton when a config module does the same in fewer lines and is more Pythonic?

A singleton prevents namespace overlap so that you don't accidentally use the same global variable somewhere else for something else. However, this largely applies to big projects where the chances of that happening increase.

After doing all this to understand the approaches of each, I decided I should probably rewrite the code to use the config module instead. For a simple project like this, a singleton is just overkill - even though learning about them was a great way to spend the morning.
