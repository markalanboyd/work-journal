Ran into a problem trying to create this template because it wanted you to create a header template that includes the upper `<html>` tag and then a footer template that creates the lower closing tag. The problem is that when I autosave, the autocorrect tries to be helpful and automatically closes that unclosed tag in the header, so it wasn't appearing when I imported it.

Damn, I'm having a really hard time trying to turn off auto closing tags. I'm trying to turn it off from the VS Code settings and from the Prettier formatter by using `<!-- prettier-ignore -->` at the top of the file, but something's not working.

I was able to get it to work by turning Prettier off for the workspace, but that seems like a less than ideal situation since I want to use it in other files. Will have to investigate further later how to do this on a per-file basis.

I still couldn't get the header to work until I pasted the solution in - I must've messed something up but I don't feel like tracking it down right now.

I asked ChatGPT if splitting these tags was best practice for Jinja and it says it's not. You should instead use a base template like this:

###### base.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>{% block title %}Default Title{% endblock %}</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        {% block content %} {% endblock %}
    </body>
</html>
```

You then extend the base template with child templates, like so:

###### child.html

```html
{% extends "base.html" %} {% block title %}Child Page{% endblock %} {% block
content %}
<p>This is the child page.</p>
{% endblock %}
```

This is something I learned a few days ago, but since the lesson is designed a little stupidly, I didn't think to move in this direction. This method totally avoids breaking two related tags into two different files, which seems like it'd be a nightmare to figure out what's wrong (hence me not even bothering to try to figure out what stupid typo I made that made it not work earlier).

I will attempt to refactor the lesson into this inheritance pattern.
