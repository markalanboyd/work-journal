## Intro to Flask Continued

Today I'm still working on getting to know Flask. Later I'll be making an over/under game website as a challenge.

### Bold decorating

I was trying to complete a challenge about creating my own function decorators and ran into a roadblock. Why wasn't this code working?

```python
def bold(func):
    def wrapper():
        return f"<b>{func()}</b>"

    return wrapper


@bold
@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

Well, it turns out the decorators work in order of closest to the function to furthest, so in this case, the `@app.route` does its thing, and then you're what - wrapping `<b>` tags around the framework I suppose?

This is the correct order:

```python
@app.route("/")
@bold
def hello_world():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

Something else I discovered: you can't put anything between the decorators or they disassociate.

Below, I was trying to debug some decorators by commenting them out, and then all of a sudden my website wasn't loading anymore.

```python
@app.route("/")
# @underline
# @emphasis
@bold
def hello_world():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

What I needed to do instead was:

```python
# @underline
# @emphasis
@app.route("/")
@bold
def hello_world():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

### Accessing `*args` within a decorator

You can access the positional arguments of the function being passed into the wrapper like so:

```python
def only_even(func):
    def wrapper(n):
        if n % 2 == 0:
            func(n)
    return wrapper

@only_even
def print_even(n):
    print(f"The number {n} is even.")

print_even(4)  # Output: "The number 4 is even."
print_even(3)  # No output

```

Here is a more complex example that uses `*args`, which allows you to pass in an arbitrary number of positional arguments.

```python
def all_positive(func):
    def wrapper(*args):
        if all(x > 0 for x in args):
            return func(*args)
        else:
            print("Some arguments are not positive.")
    return wrapper

@all_positive
def add(a, b):
    print(f"The sum is: {a + b}")

@all_positive
def multiply(a, b, c):
    print(f"The product is: {a * b * c}")

add(5, 3)  # Output: "The sum is: 8"
add(-1, 3)  # Output: "Some arguments are not positive."

multiply(1, 2, 3)  # Output: "The product is: 6"
multiply(-1, 2, 3)  # Output: "Some arguments are not positive."
```

### The `all()` function and generator expression

From this example I learned about the `all()` function. It takes an iterable as an argument and returns `True` if all the elements in the iterable are true.

```python
if all(x > 0 for x in args):
```

This line uses a generator expression to check if each value `x` in `args` is greater than zero. The generator function does not create a list like in a list comprehension, it rather iterates over the whole list and presents the items to the `all()` function one at a time. This is memory efficient since it's only ever storing one value at a time.

The `all()` function is also short-circuiting, meaning it stops evaluating the generator expression once it hits the first `False`.

Ultimately, this is a great pattern to use to check if everything in an iterable meets some condition. No need to set up a `for` loop.

### kwargs in decorators

Going back to the decorator, below is an example of how to pass keyword arguments through to a function.

```python
def requires_permission(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if kwargs.get('is_authorized', False):
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        else:
            print("Permission denied.")
    return wrapper

@requires_permission
def perform_action(user, action, is_authorized=False):
    print(f"{user} performed {action}.")

perform_action("Alice", "read", is_authorized=True)  # Output: "Alice performed read."
perform_action("Bob", "write")  # Output: "Permission denied."
perform_action("Eve", "delete", is_authorized=False)  # Output: "Permission denied."
```

### What \* and \*\* mean

Also good to note that the asterix in `*args` groups the positional arguments into a tuple, and the double asterix in `**kwargs` groups the keyword arguments into a dictionary.

##### \*args

```python
def func_with_args(*args):
    for arg in args:
        print(arg)

func_with_args(1, 2, 3)  # Prints 1, then 2, then 3
```

##### \*\*kwargs

```python
def func_with_kwargs(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

func_with_kwargs(a=1, b=2)  # Prints "a: 1", then "b: 2"
```

## Flask High-Low Game

I successfully completed this challenge from Day 55 of the 100 Days of Code Python course. The code for it is here - I might expand it a little at some point to do error checking and maybe have some kind of buttons that lead you to the page so you don't have to just type it in the address bar.

The repository for this is [here](https://github.com/markalanboyd/flask-higher-lower).

```python
import random

from flask import Flask
from pathlib import Path

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the html pages into variables
home = Path("home.html").read_text()
too_high = Path("too-high.html").read_text()
too_low = Path("too-low.html").read_text()
correct = Path("correct.html").read_text()

# Pick random integer that will be the goal
random_int = random.randint(0, 9)


@app.route("/")
def home_page():
    return home

# The user has to enter a number at the end of the address to input their guess
@app.route("/<int:number>")
def correct_page(number):
    if number == random_int:
        return correct
    if number > random_int:
        return too_high
    else:
        return too_low


app.run(debug=True)

```

## Rendering HTML

I suppose the way I was handling HTML files before wasn't entirely correct for the Flask framework, which makes sense. Before I was holding every webpage in memory, whereas this method just calls them as needed.

You want to use the method `render_template` like this [from their documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/quickstart/#rendering-templates):

```python
from flask import render_template

@app.route('/hello/')
@app.route('/hello/<name>')
def hello(name=None):
    return render_template('hello.html', name=name)
```

For structuring your files, you can choose to structure them as a module or as a package.

##### Case 1: a module:

```
/application.py
/templates
    /hello.html
```

Modules are good for small projects, learning or prototyping, and usually a solo dev.

##### Case 2: a package:

```
/application
    /__init__.py
    /templates
        /hello.html
```

Packages, which contain an `__init__.py` file that initializes the Flask application and brings together components, is more suited for larger projects, teams, and situations where you need multiple environments (dev, test, prod).

This is also an interesting bit at the beginning of the docs in this section:

> Generating HTML from within Python is not fun, and actually pretty cumbersome because you have to do the HTML escaping on your own to keep the application secure. Because of that Flask configures the Jinja2 template engine for you automatically.

I asked ChatGPT to explain this part to me and it gave me this example:

```python
def hello(name):
    return "<html><head><title>Hello, world!</title></head><body><h1>Hello, " + name + "!</h1></body></html>"
```

As you can see it's a pretty verbose way to do something that should be really simple. However, this also leaves you open to cross-site scripting attacks where someone could inject code into that `name` variable that would run on your server.

For that, you'd need to then use the `html` library and use the `escape()` method like this:

```python
import html

def hello(name):
    safe_name = html.escape(name)
    return "<html><head><title>Hello, world!</title></head><body><h1>Hello, " + safe_name + "!</h1></body></html>"
```

Flask leverages Jinja2 to allow you to write your HTML files separately, insert variables, and it also automatically escapes HTML.

For example:

##### HTML

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hello, world!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

##### Python

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/hello/<name>')
def hello(name):
    return render_template('hello.html', name=name)
```

## Rendering Static Files

You have to stick your static files (like images into a folder called `static`. They have to be accessed using the folder structure like this:

```html
<img src="static/hello.jpg" />
```

Good to note that CSS files also go into the `static` folder.

Also, since Chrome likes to cache CSS files, you can hard reload by pressing shift when clicking the reload button and that will grab the newest version. You can also do `cmd+shift+r`.

## Name Card Website with Flask

I followed the tutorial and downloaded a template file for a website, filled in my info and a picture of me, and altered it a little to link just to my Github and Linkedin profiles.

This is the result: [flask-name-card-website](https://github.com/markalanboyd/flask-name-card-website)
