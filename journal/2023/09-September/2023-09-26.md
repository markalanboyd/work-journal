## Intro to Flask Continued

Today I'm still working on getting to know Flask. Later I'll be making an over/under game website as a challenge.

### Bold decorating

I was trying to complete a challenge about creating my own function decorators and ran into a roadblock. Why wasn't this code working?

```python
def bold(func):
    def wrapper():
        return f"<b>{func()}</b>"

    return wrapper


@bold
@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

Well, it turns out the decorators work in order of closest to the function to furthest, so in this case, the `@app.route` does its thing, and then you're what - wrapping `<b>` tags around the framework I suppose?

This is the correct order:

```python
@app.route("/")
@bold
def hello_world():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

Something else I discovered: you can't put anything between the decorators or they disassociate.

Below, I was trying to debug some decorators by commenting them out, and then all of a sudden my website wasn't loading anymore.

```python
@app.route("/")
# @underline
# @emphasis
@bold
def hello_world():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

What I needed to do instead was:

```python
# @underline
# @emphasis
@app.route("/")
@bold
def hello_world():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

### Accessing `*args` within a decorator

You can access the positional arguments of the function being passed into the wrapper like so:

```python
def only_even(func):
    def wrapper(n):
        if n % 2 == 0:
            func(n)
    return wrapper

@only_even
def print_even(n):
    print(f"The number {n} is even.")

print_even(4)  # Output: "The number 4 is even."
print_even(3)  # No output

```

Here is a more complex example that uses `*args`, which allows you to pass in an arbitrary number of positional arguments.

```python
def all_positive(func):
    def wrapper(*args):
        if all(x > 0 for x in args):
            return func(*args)
        else:
            print("Some arguments are not positive.")
    return wrapper

@all_positive
def add(a, b):
    print(f"The sum is: {a + b}")

@all_positive
def multiply(a, b, c):
    print(f"The product is: {a * b * c}")

add(5, 3)  # Output: "The sum is: 8"
add(-1, 3)  # Output: "Some arguments are not positive."

multiply(1, 2, 3)  # Output: "The product is: 6"
multiply(-1, 2, 3)  # Output: "Some arguments are not positive."
```

## The `all()` function and generator expression

From this example I learned about the `all()` function. It takes an iterable as an argument and returns `True` if all the elements in the iterable are true.

```python
if all(x > 0 for x in args):
```

This line uses a generator expression to check if each value `x` in `args` is greater than zero. The generator function does not create a list like in a list comprehension, it rather iterates over the whole list and presents the items to the `all()` function one at a time. This is memory efficient since it's only ever storing one value at a time.

The `all()` function is also short-circuiting, meaning it stops evaluating the generator expression once it hits the first `False`.

Ultimately, this is a great pattern to use to check if everything in an iterable meets some condition. No need to set up a `for` loop.

### kwargs in decorators

Going back to the decorator, below is an example of how to pass keyword arguments through to a function.

```python
def requires_permission(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if kwargs.get('is_authorized', False):
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        else:
            print("Permission denied.")
    return wrapper

@requires_permission
def perform_action(user, action, is_authorized=False):
    print(f"{user} performed {action}.")

perform_action("Alice", "read", is_authorized=True)  # Output: "Alice performed read."
perform_action("Bob", "write")  # Output: "Permission denied."
perform_action("Eve", "delete", is_authorized=False)  # Output: "Permission denied."
```

### What \* and \*\* mean

Also good to note that the asterix in `*args` groups the positional arguments into a tuple, and the double asterix in `**kwargs` groups the keyword arguments into a dictionary.

##### \*args

```python
def func_with_args(*args):
    for arg in args:
        print(arg)

func_with_args(1, 2, 3)  # Prints 1, then 2, then 3
```

##### \*\*kwargs

```python
def func_with_kwargs(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

func_with_kwargs(a=1, b=2)  # Prints "a: 1", then "b: 2"
```
