## Intro to Flask 3

Looks like today we're going to make a lil blog with Flask and Jinja.

Jinja is a templating engine for Python. You can define placeholders that get replaced with data at runtime server-side. Here are some of the basic syntax and ways of using it.

| Placeholder          | Description                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `{{ variable }}`     | Renders a variable                                  |
| `{% for x in y %}`   | Starts a for-loop                                   |
| `{% endfor %}`       | Ends a for-loop                                     |
| `{% if condition %}` | Starts an if-statement                              |
| `{% endif %}`        | Ends an if-statement                                |
| `{% else %}`         | Else branch in an if-statement or for-loop          |
| `{% elif %}`         | Else-If branch in an if-statement                   |
| `{{ x\|filter }}`    | Applies a filter to a variable (e.g., `capitalize`) |

##### `for` loop

```jinja
{% for item in items %}
    <p>{{ item }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

##### `if else`

```jinja
{% if user_is_admin %}
    <p>Welcome, admin!</p>
{% else %}
    <p>Welcome, guest!</p>
{% endif %}
```

##### `filter`

```jinja
<!-- Output name in title case -->
{{ name|title }}
```

##### `comments`

```jinja
{# This is a comment and won't be rendered in the HTML output. #}
```

##### whitespace control

```jinja
<!-- Strips whitespace before and after the element -->
{%- if user_is_admin -%}
    <p>Welcome, admin!</p>
{%- endif -%}
```

##### inheritance

Inheritance is a really powerful feature that allows you to define a base template that you can then easily fill in with child templates. I assume this is what we're going to be using today to help with the blog project - creating some kind of base template for each blog post and using the `child.html` to write each post.

###### base.html

```jinja
<html>
<head>
    <title>{% block title %}Default Title{% endblock %}</title>
</head>
<body>
    {% block content %}{% endblock %}
</body>
</html>
```

###### child.html

```jinja
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block title %}My Page{% endblock %}
{% block content %}
    <p>This is my page.</p>
{% endblock %}
```

###### output.html

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This is my page.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

##### Sending parameters to HTML file

You can pass parameters from your Python file to the HTML file as keyword arguments in the `render_template` method.

###### app.py

```python
def home():
    random_int = random.randint(1, 10)
    return render_template("index.html", num=random_int)
```

###### home.html

```jinja
<p>Random number is: {{ num }}</p>
```

### Dynamic Footer Copyright

A lot of websites hardcode their copyright year into their footer. Why not use code to do that automatically? Here's how to do that.

In the `app.py` file we need to import the `datetime` module and get the current year from it. We then need to pass that as a variable to our `index.html` file through the `render_template` method.

##### app.py

```python
from datetime import datetime
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

current_year = datetime.now().year


@app.route("/")
def home():
    return render_template("index.html", year=current_year)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Inside the `index.html` file all we need to do then is create a `<footer>` with `{{ year }}` as a variable.

##### index.html

```jinja
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta
            name="viewport"
            content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
        />
        <title>Test</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello work</h1>
    </body>
    <footer>
        <p>Copyright {{ year }} Mark Boyd</p>
    </footer>
</html>

```

### Flask Age-Gender-Nationality Guesser

I completed the challenge to make a age and gender guesser using an API and added on the nationality as a bonus. The repo is [here](https://github.com/markalanboyd/flask-age-gender-nationality-guesser).

The output looks like this:

`http://127.0.0.1:5000/Mark`

> Hi Mark! According to my data, my best guess is that you are a male who is 58 years old from Philippines ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­.

The API was giving me back country codes for country names so I asked ChatGPT to make a dictionary of all country codes with country names in them. That way, I could easily translate the code from the API to the proper name for the country.

This would be a nice simple project to gussy up and make into a website for my portfolio. I'd have to host it somewhere I suppose - maybe on a t2.micro on AWS or something. Or better yet, something serverless, so I only get charged when people look at it.

#### Country Code to Emoji

I also asked ChatGPT to write a function to take the country code and return the emoji flag. It would have taken me a while to puzzle this out, and it's not really on-topic for what I'm learning right now, but I'll analyze how it works here anyway:

```python
def __country_code_to_emoji(self, country_code):
    return "".join(chr(ord(c) + 127397) for c in country_code.upper())
```

1. First it takes the `country_code` and ensures it's in uppercase using the `.upper()` method.
1. Then it uses a `for` loop to iterate over each character `c` in the upper case country code.
1. The `ord(c)` function takes a single Unicode character and returns its corresponding Unicode code point, which is an integer. You're used to seeing Unicode values as `U+1F600` or something like that, but that's just the code in hexidecimal.
1. `ord(c) + 127397` - this is the offset necessary to add to the integer you get to return each of the two regional indicator values. These two values one after another (not added together) indicate the emoji for the flag of that country.
1. `chr(...)` converts the integer back into its ASCII character.
1. `"".join(...)` joins each of the regional indicators together to make the string necessary to lookup the emoji.

### Flask Blog

I learned about [npoint.io](https://www.npoint.io/) which will freely store JSON in a bin for you and serve it up at an API endpoint specificially for that bin.

We're using it in this exercise to basically take the place of a database.

#### Using `for` loop to print out posts

I got and passed the blog posts from within the function for the page like this.

##### app.py

```python
@app.route("/blog")
def blog():
    response = requests.get("https://api.npoint.io/2c815755d838e42dc4c0")
    posts = response.json()
    return render_template("blog.html", posts=posts)
```

Then I wrote a little `for` loop within the HTML file to print out each of the blog posts.

##### blog.html

```jinja
<body>
    {% for post in posts %}
    <h1>{{ post["title"] }}</h1>
    <h2><em>{{ post["subtitle"]}}</em></h2>
    <p>{{ post["body"] }}</p>
    {% endfor %}
</body>
```

#### URL Building

To add a URL into your HTML with Jinja2, you use the function `url_for()` within the HTML like this.

```jinja
<a href="{{ url_for('home') }}">Home</a>
```

NB: You have to call the name of the function, not the HTML page it's rendering. You also need to put single quotes inside because it's wrapped in double quotes.

#### Solution

This was a pretty poorly constructed lesson. It wanted me to make a `Post` class but didn't give any hint as to what it should do. I was trying to get it to grab all the posts then search through them by ID, but the data is in a flat structure so you can't just return the post by ID. I was trying to use list comprehension with the `next()` method, but never was able to get anything returned.

I gave up and looked at the solution. Turns out you're suppose to use the Post class to encapsulate data like this:

##### post.py

```python
class Post:
    def __init__(self, post_id, title, subtitle, body):
        self.id = post_id
        self.title = title
        self.subtitle = subtitle
        self.body = body
```

Then within your `app.py` file, you create a list of `post_objects` that you iterate through every time any of the blog posts are requested from the index page.

```python
posts = requests.get("https://api.npoint.io/c790b4d5cab58020d391").json()
post_objects = []
for post in posts:
    post_obj = Post(post["id"], post["title"], post["subtitle"], post["body"])
    post_objects.append(post_obj)

@app.route("/post/<int:index>")
def show_post(index):
    requested_post = None
    for blog_post in post_objects:
        if blog_post.id == index:
            requested_post = blog_post
    return render_template("post.html", post=requested_post)
```

This kinda seems like a silly way to do this. You could just properly structure the data in the first place and save a bunch of lines of code! In fact, all the class creation loop is doing is creating a better structured list of posts that could have just been structured that way to begin with.

I mean in the real world, you wouldn't return your entire database of posts when you just request one post, but still - this would have been a much easier exercise if the data was structured like:

```json
{
    "1": {
        "title": "Life of Cactus",
        "subtitle": "Cacti lives.",
        "body": "Nori grape..."
    },
    "2": {
        "title": "When Bored",
        "subtitle": "Top 15 activities.",
        "body": "Chase ball..."
    },
    "3": {
        "title": "Intermittent Fasting",
        "subtitle": "New health craze.",
        "body": "Cupcake..."
    }
}
```
