## Blog Capstone Part 3

### Adding `POST` functionality to contact form

I continued what I left off with yesterday and added `POST` functionality to the blog. The 2 important things to remember that you need to include in your HTML form is the `method="post"` at the top of the form and the `name` attribute for each item being sent. You access each item by using `request.form["name"]` within the code.

This was the simple code I used to check that I was doing it correctly:

```python
@app.route("/contact", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def contact():
    if request.method == "POST":
        print(request.form["name"])
        print(request.form["email"])
        print(request.form["phone"])
        print(request.form["message"])
        return "Success!"
    return render_template("contact.html")
```

### Adding email functionality with `smtplib`

It's way too cumbersome to use Gmail accounts for this, but Yahoo is still a good way to go.

Important to remember you have to create an app password in your Yahoo account security settings, not your email settings.

Ah well Yahoo doesn't want to cooperate today and won't let me generate an app password, so I will just explain how this is done and hope it's correct.

```python
import os
import requests
import smtplib

import dotenv
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
from datetime import datetime

dotenv.load_dotenv()

# Load the environment variables
dotenv.load_dotenv()

# Set the email and password combo to constants
EMAIL = os.getenv("EMAIL")
PW = os.getenv("PW")

# Omitted irrelevant code used to render other pages

# This function takes the POST request and parses it into a string to use in as the email subject and body
def parse_message(request):
    name = request.form["name"]
    email = request.form["email"]
    phone = request.form["phone"]
    message = request.form["message"]

    # The first line of the email_content is the subject, the rest is the body
    email_content = f"""Contact submission form from {name}
    From: {email}
    Phone: {phone}
    Message: {message}
    """

    return email_content


def send_mail(from_email, from_pw, request):
    email_content = parse_message(request)
    smtp_server = "smtp.mail.yahoo.com"
    smtp_port = 587
    smtp_object = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port)
    smtp_object.starttls()
    smtp_object.login(from_email, from_pw)
    # In this case, we're sending the email from ourselves to ourselves
    smtp_object.sendmail(from_email, from_email, email_content)
    smtp_object.quit()


@app.route("/contact", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def contact():
    if request.method == "POST":
        send_mail(EMAIL, PW, request)
        return "Success!"
    return render_template("contact.html")
```

This method is good for low traffic where you're not expecting many people to send a message very frequently (like on a personal blog page). However, if you had a larger audience sending more messages, you'd have to choose one of several options for handling them such as connection pooling, batch processing, a persistent open connection for the session, or asynchronous sending. All of these require varying degrees of added complexity, but are worth doing when working on a larger project.

### Better forms with Flask-WTF

Flask-WTF extends the Flask framework by adding useful features that make creating forms easier and more secure. It adds form validation, reduces the amount of code you need to write, and has built-in cross site request forgery (CSRF) protection.

I struggled a lot with this today not realizing I was yet again not reading the latest version of the docs somehow. This is a really silly problem and I don't know how I keep doing this for some frameworks. I tried to go to the base URL and I ended up getting some v1.2 and thought that was the newest, but no, it's on v3 now. Ugh.

I got things half-working, but don't have time to explain what I did just now, I will start tomorrow's entry with that.
