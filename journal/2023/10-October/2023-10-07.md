## Top 10 Movie Website

I'm taking this opportunity to learn more about file structure, going beyond the requirements of the lesson in an effort to figure out how real projects are structured.

```
📁 app
│   ├── 🐍 __init__.py
│   └── 🛣️ routes.py
📁 instance
│   └── 🗄️ movies.db
📁 models
│   ├── 📋 forms.py
│   └── 🎬 movie.py
📁 services
│   └── ⚙️ services.py
📁 static
│   └── 📁 css
│       └── 🎨 styles.css
📁 templates
│   ├── ➕ add.html
│   ├── 📜 base.html
│   ├── ✏️ edit.html
│   ├── 🏠 index.html
│   └── 🔍 select.html
📄 🏃 run.py
```

This is the structure I chose for this project. There is no one right way to structure Flask apps, but from what I understand this flat structure is more conducive to expansion in the future if you want to make dev, test, and prod versions of the app.

Note this code is unfinished, but I wanted to explain the file structure before moving forward too far.

### `app`
```
📁 app
│   ├── 🐍 __init__.py
│   └── 🛣️ routes.py
```
In the app folder we have an `__init__.py` file and a `routes.py` file. The init file does a few things.

#### `app/__init__.py`
```python
# __init__.py
from flask import Flask
from flask_bootstrap import Bootstrap5
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()
bootstrap = Bootstrap5()


def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__, template_folder="../templates", static_folder="../static")
    app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = "8BYkEfBA6O6donzWlSihBXox7C0sKR6b"
    app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = "sqlite:///movies.db"

    bootstrap.init_app(app)
    db.init_app(app)

    from app.routes import main

    app.register_blueprint(main)

    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all()

    return app
```

The pattern we're using here is called an application factory.

First we instantiate the database and Bootstrap outside of the `create_app()` function. There are two reasons for this. One is that you can then easily access these variables outside of this file, and the second is that we can write multiple `create_app()` functions to create dev, test, and prod environments with different configurations.

Then, within the `create_app()` function, we're creating the `app` variable, pointing at the correct location of the template folder (since this init file and the templates folder are no longer on a flat file structure at the root). Then we set the secret key necessary for generating `wtforms` tokens as well as the SQLAlchemy database URI.

After setting these configurations, we then initialize Bootstrap and the database by passing the Flask app to them so they can understand the context they're working with.

Next we import the `main` variable from the `app.routes` package which is a Flask `Blueprint` object. We then register the blueprint object to the app.

Blueprints allow you to avoid circular imports where, for instance, the models need to use the app context and the app needs to import the models. You can also make multiple blueprints again for the purposes of creating different environments with their own resources and routes.

Next we use the context of the app to create all of the tables with `db.create_all()`. This enables SQLAlchemy to see the app's models and configuration in order to create the tables which don't already exist.

Finally, we return the app which we use later in `run.py` to run the app.

#### `routes.py`

This file is where we keep all of our routes for our webpages.

```python
from flask import Blueprint, render_template, redirect, url_for, flash
from models.forms import MovieForm
from services.services import create_movie, get_movies

main = Blueprint("main", __name__)


@main.route("/")
def home():
    movies = get_movies()
    return render_template("index.html", movies=movies)


@main.route("/add-movie", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def add_movie():
    form = MovieForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        try:
            create_movie(form)
            return redirect(url_for("main.home"))
        except ValueError as e:
            flash(str(e), "error")
    return render_template("add.html", form=form)
```

Here we declare the blueprint that we'd imported earlier in the init file. The first argument is the name of the blueprint and the second is the name of the module where the blueprint is defined, which is this current one.

Note that now instead of `@app.route` we use `@main.route`.

Blueprints can help keep parts of your app logically separated. For example, you can have a `user` blueprint that would contain things like user profiles and settings, and a `admin` blueprint that is only intended to be accessible to administrators. You could have a `shop` blueprint that contains all the product listing, cart, and payment routes, and a `blog` blueprint that contains the routes for displaying articles.

In our case, we're using just one blueprint solely for the purpose of avoiding circular inputs, so we can just call it `main`.

I won't dive into explaining the code line by line, but I wanted to also point out that I'm making an effort to keep each route as condensed and manageable as possible by not including all its logic within the route itself. The logic is kept separate in `models` and `services`. This makes the code easier to read and maintain.

Models are classes and services are functions that interact with resources like getting and committing information to a database. They are different from utils in that they aren't 

### instance/movies.db

This is just where the database is held. It and the folder containing it is automatically created by SQLAlchemy if it doesn't already exist.

### Models
