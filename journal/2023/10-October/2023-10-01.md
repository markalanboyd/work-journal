## Blog Capstone Part 2

### What's in a `__name__`?

I always thought the `main` in `if __name__ == "__main__"` was referring to the fact that you'd name your files `main.py`, but it's actually that whatever file you run is designated as `__main__` in the `__name__` attribute.

### HTTP Methods in Flask

So we're trying to create a contact form on our blog website, and we're first practicing creating a username and password form.

Here's the HTML I came up with:

```html
<form action="/login" method="post">
    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input type="text" name="username" id="username" required /><br />
    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" name="password" id="password" required /><br />
    <input type="submit" value="Login" />
</form>
```

To get access to this info that we're sending to our Flask server, we need to import the request module from flask as well.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        password = request.form['password']
        # Do something with the username and password
        # like authentication, database storage, etc.
        return f"Received username: {username}, password: {password}"
    return render_template("login.html")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In the example above, the `/login` route handles both `GET` and `POST` requests because you can tap into the `request.method` to check which it is. If you're getting a `POST` request, you can further tap into whatever info you're getting from the form as it comes by accessing the HTML `name` attribute you've assigned it.
