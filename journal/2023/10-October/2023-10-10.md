## RESTful APIs

### PUT New Cafe

With Postman, we can test our API without having to create a form. This seems handy especially when you're working on the backend and the form itself is maybe the frontend devs' job.

```python
new_cafe = Cafe(
    name=request.form.get("name"),
    map_url=request.form.get("map_url"),
    #...
)
```

All you have to do then is to create a `add_cafe` route with a `Cafe()` object like so, and in Postman you can send all of the parameters according to how they appear in the quotes here: `.get("parameter")`.


### PATCH Update Coffee Price

Using the PATCH method, you can update just one item in a row and send that instead of having to send the entire row.

```python
@app.route("/update-price/<int:cafe_id>", methods=["PATCH"])
def patch_new_price(cafe_id):
    new_price = request.args.get("new_price")
    cafe = db.get_or_404(Cafe, cafe_id)
    if not cafe:
        return jsonify(
            error={
                "Not Found": "Sorry a cafe with that id was not found in the database."
            }
        )
    cafe.coffee_price = new_price
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify(response={"success": "Successfully updated the price."})
```
