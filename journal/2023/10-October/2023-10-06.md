## Top 10 Movie Website

Today I graduated past `main.py` and started learning about how to properly structure larger projects. This Top 10 Movie Website isn't so big, but since we're heading in the direction of a fullstack application, I wanted to become familiar with how to set up a larger project.

I ended up getting really deep into learning about more advanced file structure for Flask apps, and I ran out of time to document it. I will start tomorrow by doing that.
