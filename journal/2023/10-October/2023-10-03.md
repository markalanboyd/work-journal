Today we're continuing to use the wtforms library to create a login field.

### CSRF Protection

To enable cross-site request forgery protection with wtforms, you need to provide a secret key. You don't want your secret key hardcoded into your `main.py` file, so it's better to keep it in a `.env` file and load it.

I keep forgetting how to use `.env` files and have to look it up every single time, so I'll write about it here to help cement my memory:

###### main.py

```python
import os
import dotenv # pip install python-dotenv

# This finds the .env file in your directory
# and loads it as environmental variables
# that the os library can then access
dotenv.load_dotenv()

# The getenv method takes as an argument the
# name of the variable as a string
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY")
```

###### .env

```zsh
SECRET_KEY=ahlnasdghuiasg983adfg899aklagk
```

An important thing to remember is to not put quotes around strings in the `.env` file.

Once you have loaded your key, you have to assign it to the Flask config like this:

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = SECRET_KEY
```

As a final step, you have to remember to add the `form.csrf_token` to the template file as the first line of the `form` HTML element.

```jinja
<form method="POST" action="/login">
    {{ form.csrf_token }} # <-- Right here
    {{ form.email.label }} {{ form.email(size=20) }}
    {% if form.email.errors %}
        <ul>
            {% for error in form.email.errors %}
                <li>{{ error }}</li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    {% endif %}
    {{ form.password.label }} {{ form.password(size=20) }}
    <input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>
```

### Intro to wtforms

To create a form with wtforms, you first create a class that has all of the fields you want in your form. [Here's a link to all of the elements as of 3.0.x.](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.x/fields/#basic-fields)

```python
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField, EmailField, PasswordField
from wtforms.validators import DataRequired

class LoginForm(FlaskForm):
    name = StringField("name")
    email = EmailField("email", validators=[DataRequired()])
    password = PasswordField("password", validators=[DataRequired()])
```

Here we're creating the basis for a form that has an optional `name` field and a required `email` and `password` field.

The `EmailField` class you import will automatically validate the email. You used to have to import a separate validator for that, but that's from an older version of wtforms.

`PasswordField` will also automatically blank out the characters as you type them.

```python
@app.route("/login", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def login():
    form = LoginForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        name = form.name.data
        if len(name) == 0:
            name = "Anonymous"
        email = form.email.data
        password = form.password.data
        return f"Hello {name} your email is: {email} and pw is: {password}"
    return render_template("login.html", form=form)
```

In our `/login` route here, we have to make sure we have the `GET` and `POST` methods enabled for our page. Then, we instantiate an instance of `LoginForm()` as `form`, which we are passing into the template through the `render_template()` function. This allows us to later call on the class and its attributes to build the form like this.

```jinja
<h1>Login</h1>
<form method="POST" action="/login">
    {{ form.csrf_token }}
    {{ form.name.label }} {{ form.name(size=20) }}
    {{ form.email.label }} {{ form.email(size=20) }}
    {% if form.email.errors %}
        <ul>
            {% for error in form.email.errors %}
                <li>{{ error }}</li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    {% endif %}
    {{ form.password.label }} {{ form.password(size=20) }}
    <input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>
```

So you can create a label just by calling `form.name.label` and then resize the field of the name input by using `form.name(size=20)` where `20` is the number of characters the box is wide (though note, this does not limit the max number of characters).

In this example, we check if there are any items in the list `form.email.errors`, and if so, we list them underneath the email field.

```python
@app.route("/login", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def login():
    form = LoginForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        name = form.name.data
        if len(name) == 0:
            name = "Anonymous"
        email = form.email.data
        password = form.password.data
        return f"Hello {name} your email is: {email} and pw is: {password}"
    return render_template("login.html", form=form)
```

Jumping back to this code, once we press submit on our form and the value returned by `form.validate_on_submit` is `True` (that is, no errors were found), we can do things with the information passed to the form, which in this case is print out a message.

Of course, if this was some kind of real login page, you'd stick your authentication logic there. You can also use the `redirect()` method to send them to another route, like:

```python
@app.route("/login", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def login():
    form = LoginForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        # Authentication logic
        return redirect("/success")
    return render_template("login.html", form=form)

@app.route("/success")
def success():
    return "Logged in successfully!"
```
