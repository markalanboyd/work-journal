## Game Dev

I decided to look back into doing game dev as a fun exercise on the weekends. I'm a little torn between starting with Godot or Unreal, but I'm leaning towards Godot just because it's supposed to be easier.

Some good advice I saw today was to not worry about making your dream game from the start. Just try to make some simple games for practice at first and really nail down the one mechanic.

I'll try to brainstorm some ideas for games to work on throughout the week - perhaps look at some starter game ideas. I think I want to try to just sort of open the program up and just go rather than watch a tutorial - I'm really sick of doing tutorials in fact. It definitely feels like I'm on some kind of treadmill with those.
