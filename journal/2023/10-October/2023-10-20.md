## Authentication with Flask

First we have to register new users for our site.

```python
@app.route("/register", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def register():
    if request.method == "POST":
        new_user = User(
            email=request.form.get("email"),
            password=request.form.get("password"),
            name=request.form.get("name"),
        )
        db.session.add(new_user)
        db.session.commit()
        return render_template("secrets.html")
    return render_template("register.html")
```

We're not using wtforms for this so we use the `request` method from Flask to get the content of the form.

This is an insecure way of registering users if you're not using HTTPS. It's also a bad idea to store passwords as plaintext in your database, but perhaps there's a method explained later on on how to encrypt passwords with Flask.

It does seem there is a way to use Flask to do more secure logins but I'll have to save that for another day.
