## Virtual Bookshelf with Flask and SQLite

Today I'm finally learning about databases and how to work with them.

### SQLite 101

SQLite is so popular it's a built-in library for Python. This is some example code that we'll be using for the Virtual Bookshelf project:

```python
import sqlite3

db = sqlite3.connect("books-collection.db")

cursor = db.cursor()

sql_query = """CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title varchar(250) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    author varchar(250) NOT NULL,
    rating FLOAT NOT NULL
)"""

cursor.execute(sql_query)
```

First we of course import `sqlite3` and then create our database by calling `sqlite3.connect("books-collection.db")`. If the database isn't present in the file already, it gets created. If it is, it is just connected to.

We then have to create a cursor with the line `cursor = db.cursor()`, which will be the method in which we interact with the database.

To create a new table for our collection, we have to use the SQL language, which is passed to `cursor.execute()` as a query.

With the query, we're creating a table called books. If it already exists, it just skips this process with the check `IF NOT EXISTS`. It sets a column called `id` which is of the `INTEGER` type as the primary key, or the primary method by which books will be searched for. Primary keys must be unique.

The `title` column has a few conditions put on it. `varchar(250)` lets the entry be any character up to 250 characters in length. The length limit is helpful to prevent accidental or malicious insertions of large amounts of data. It is also `NOT NULL` meaning the query to add a new entry will be rejected if the field isn't filled out and the column must also be `UNIQUE` or the query will also be rejected.

The `author` column is required but it doesn't need to be unique as of course people could read multiple books by the same author.

The `rating` column is set to `FLOAT` to allow decimal ratings and is also required.

You can't view this database file directly without either an external program like [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/) or a plugin for VS Code like [SQLite Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qwtel.sqlite-viewer).

To add a row, we have to do a few things.

```python
data = (1, 'Harry Potter', 'J. K. Rowling', 9.3)
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO books VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?)", data)
db.commit()
```

First things first, you want to protect yourself from SQL injection attacks, which means you want to split your data up from your `cursor.execute()` command so that the data is only ever treated as data and not executable code.

This way, we pass `data` into the `execute()` function while using the `INSERT INTO books` command. In the `VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?)` function the question marks placeholders for the data you're passing through via the tuple. You must make sure the tuple and `VALUES(?)` match in length or you will get an error that says you have an incorrect number of bindings.

Finally, you have to then call `db.commit()` to actually push the changes to the database.
