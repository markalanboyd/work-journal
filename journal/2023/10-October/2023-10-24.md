## React Tutorial

Since I want to learn Next.js it seems prudent to first go back and learn React. I'm doing this NetNinja course on YouTube.

The first thing I had to do was install node which helps create the components you need for a React app with the command `npx create-react-app [app-name]`.

### Anonymous functions

In this example, we create a function that will greet the user in the console. To prevent the function from firing as the webpage is loaded, we use an anonymous function to return the function with the variable loaded in it only when the button is clicked.

```js
const Home = () => {

    const handleClick = (name) => {
        console.log("Hello " + name);
    }

    return ( 
        <div className="home">
            <h2>Homepage</h2>
            <button onClick={() => {handleClick("Mark")}}>Click me again</button>
        </div>
     );
}
 
export default Home;
```

If you didn't do it this way, there'd be no way to pass a variable to the function.

If you want to get more detailed information about the event, you can pass in an `e` like this.

```js
const Home = () => {

    const handleClick = (name, e) => {
        console.log("Hello " + name, e);
    }

    return ( 
        <div className="home">
            <h2>Homepage</h2>
            <button onClick={(e) => {handleClick("Mark", e)}}>Click me again</button>
        </div>
     );
}
 
export default Home;
```

The `e` can be labeled anything, but conventionally it stands for the click event. There's a ton of info that comes with the click that you can use when needed.

You can access specific properties like `e.target`, which would return the HTML for the button itself.
