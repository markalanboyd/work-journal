## Blog Capstone Part 5

I just learneda bout the `super()` method for Jinja which allows you to inherit within a particular block.

This particular bit of CSS styling is present in the `base.html` file.

```jinja
<style>
    {% block style %}
        body {
            background: purple;
        }
    {% endblock style %}
</style>
```

If we want to extend this styling in another template, all we have to do is call the `super()` method, which inserts everything from the template into the block, after which you can then alter the styling.

```jinja
{% block style %}
	{{ super() }}
	h1 {
		color: red;
	}
{% endblock style %}
```

You call it as if it is a variable since it is essentially returning the text of the part of the template it's inheriting from. If you left out the `super()` method, the code would overwrite all of the styling, so instead of having a purple background and a red h1, it would only have a red h1.

### Bootstrap-Flask

Bootstrap-Flask is confusingly a fork of Flask-Bootstrap, and you import it using the statement

```python
from flask_bootstrap import Bootstrap5
```

You then also have to instatiate a class after you've created your app like this:

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = SECRET_KEY

bootstrap = Bootstrap5(app)
```

Afterwards, you can then import Bootstrap CSS and JS into the `base.html`template like this:

```jinja
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    {% block styles %}
    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    {{ bootstrap.load_css() }}
    {% endblock styles %}
    <title>{% block title %}{% endblock title %}</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    {% block content %}{% endblock content %}
    {% block scripts %}
    <!-- Bootstrap JS -->
    {{ bootstrap.load_js() }} {% endblock scripts %}
  </body>

</html>
```

After the `meta` tag you just insert a block that you can refer to as `styles` and then call the `bootstrap.load_css()` method within a variable frame. Same goes for the Boostsrap JavaScript, though you of course do that just before the ending `body` tag.

BTW it's too much a pain in the ass to fight against Prettier, which does not have support for Jinja. I can keep researching for something more suitable, and people mentioned creating a plugin for Prettier to help, but so far no dice. So for now at least I'll just let it mangle the formatting, because writing HTML without a linter sucks as much if not more so.

Another great thing about Boostrap-Flask is that you can use its methods to seriously condense the amount of HTML you have to write. For instance, in this example below, you just need to import `render_form` from the appropriate Bootstrap version and use one line to create the whole form.

```jinja
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block title %}Login{% endblock title %}

{% block content %}
{% from 'bootstrap5/form.html' import render_form %}

<div class="container">
	<h1>Login</h1>
	{{ render_form(form) }}
</div>
{% endblock content %}
```

Of course if you want to style it and make things fit in a particular way, you need to use individual `render_field()` methods. All in all though, this abstracts the class vomit away a lot and is much more pleasant to write than pure HTML. If only there were a better Jinja linter I could find!

### Cafe Rater

We're now building a little website that allows you to rate cafes based on various factors. You're also able to go to a secret page `/add` and add a cafe using a form. The data then gets rendered as a table.

One silly problem I ran into was that I couldn't get my custom CSS to load after I loaded the Bootstrap styling. I just didn't notice that the CSS file was in a folder called `css` and VSCode helpfully condensed the file structure to `static/css` which I didn't see at first.

#### Creating a table from a CSV file

The thing I had absolutely no idea how to do here was how to build the table. I thought for a while I was meant to use `render_table`, but couldn't figure out what kind of shape it was expecting the data input to be in. Turns out, it wanted you to take the data as rows and then iterate over them with a `for` loop.

```python
@app.route("/cafes")
def cafes():
    with open("cafe-data.csv", newline="", encoding="utf-8") as csv_file:
        csv_data = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=",")
        list_of_rows = []
        for row in csv_data:
            list_of_rows.append(row)
    return render_template("cafes.html", cafes=list_of_rows)
```

This example came with this code prewritten. When you go to the `/cafes` route, it opens the `cafe-data.csv` file, ensuring to use the universal `newline` option (which helps Windows/Mac/Linux cross compatibility), and sets the encoding to `utf-8` to help handle emojis.

The `csv.reader()` method goes through the `csv_file` and sorts the data into rows and columns, using the `","` as a delimiter between each column and using the newline character as the beginning of a new row. The method returns an iterable object that we can add row by row into a `list_of_rows`, which we then pass to the template as `cafes`.

```jinja
<table class="table" style="color: white">
{% for row in cafes %}
    <tr>
        {% for item in row %} {% if item[0:4] == "http" %}
        <td><a href="{{ item }}">Maps Link</a></td>
        {% else %}
        <td>{{ item }}</td>
        {% endif %} {% endfor %}
    </tr>
    {% endfor %}
</table>
```

We then use a nested `for` loop to iterate over each row, then over each item in each row. We also check if the item's first 4 characters are `http`, in which case, we change the formatting so that the link renders correctly. Otherwise, we just insert the item into each `<td>` tag.

We're going through all this hoopla I assume because they didn't want to introduce SQLAlchemy, which as I understand is necessary to work with the `render_table` Bootstrap-Flask method.

#### Adding a cafe

To add a cafe, I needed to create a wtform to handle the input.

```python
class CafeForm(FlaskForm):
    times = [
        "6AM",
        "7AM",
        "8AM",
        # ...,
        "9PM",
        "10PM",
        "11PM",
    ]

    coffee_emojis = ["☕", "☕☕", "☕☕☕", "☕☕☕☕", "☕☕☕☕☕"]
    strong_arm = ["❌", "💪", "💪💪", "💪💪💪", "💪💪💪💪", "💪💪💪💪💪"]
    plug_emojis = ["🔌", "🔌🔌", "🔌🔌🔌", "🔌🔌🔌🔌", "🔌🔌🔌🔌🔌"]

    cafe = StringField("cafe name", validators=[DataRequired()])
    location = StringField(
        "location", validators=[DataRequired(), URL(message="Enter a valid URL")]
    )
    open = SelectField("open", choices=times, validators=[DataRequired()])
    close = SelectField("close", choices=times, validators=[DataRequired()])
    coffee = SelectField("coffee", choices=coffee_emojis, validators=[DataRequired()])
    wifi = SelectField("wifi", choices=strong_arm, validators=[DataRequired()])
    power = SelectField("power", choices=plug_emojis, validators=[DataRequired()])
    submit = SubmitField(label="Submit")
```

The new thing introduced in this lesson is the `SelectField` class which allows you to create dropdown menus by setting the `choices=` argument equal to a list of choices. I also learned about the `URL()` validator which helps check if the URL entered is valid.

```python
@app.route("/add", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def add_cafe():
    form = CafeForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        data = (
            f"\n{form.cafe.data},"
            f"{form.location.data},"
            f"{form.open.data},"
            f"{form.close.data},"
            f"{form.coffee.data},"
            f"{form.wifi.data},"
            f"{form.power.data}"
        )
        with open("cafe-data.csv", "a") as file:
            file.write(data)
    return render_template("add.html", form=form)
```

For this route, we set up the form by instantiating the `CafeForm()` class as `form` and sending that through to the template.

```jinja
<h1>Add a new cafe into the database</h1>
{{ render_form(form, novalidate=True) }}
```

An important thing to remember here is that you want to turn browser validation off so you can have full control over how the validators look and work.

Once you hit submit on the form, it then assigns each bit of data to a long CSV string with a `\n` newline character at the beginning. In the process of figuring out how to write this data (something I hadn't done in a while), I found that you can use the `open()` method in append mode which just adds to the end of the file. If you use write, it will overwrite the file.

This local CSV file acts as our database, and it's good enough for now, but I'm excited to learn how to use real ones.
