## Blog Capstone Part 5

I just learneda bout the `super()` method for Jinja which allows you to inherit within a particular block.

This particular bit of CSS styling is present in the `base.html` file.

```jinja
<style>
    {% block style %}
        body {
            background: purple;
        }
    {% endblock style %}
</style>
```

If we want to extend this styling in another template, all we have to do is call the `super()` method, which inserts everything from the template into the block, after which you can then alter the styling.

```jinja
{% block style %}
	{{ super() }}
	h1 {
		color: red;
	}
{% endblock style %}
```

You call it as if it is a variable since it is essentially returning the text of the part of the template it's inheriting from. If you left out the `super()` method, the code would overwrite all of the styling, so instead of having a purple background and a red h1, it would only have a red h1.
