## RESTful Blog with Editing

So here we're using CKEditor to create a text box field with fancy editing capabilities and use that to create a new blog post.

```jinja
<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
{{ ckeditor.load() }}
<form method="post">
    {{ ckeditor.create() }}
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
</div>
```

You first have to load the ckeditor and then you call `ck.editor.create()` as the first line of your HTML `form`. Make sure to remember that the method of the form needs to be `"post"`!
