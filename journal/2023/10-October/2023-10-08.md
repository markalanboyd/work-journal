I wasn't able to get much pushed forward today since I was still documenting the file structure work I'd done, but I was able to get a couple things worked out.

### Custom Validators for wtforms

You can write a custom validator for a wtforms form by importing `ValidationError` from `wtforms.validators` and following the pattern:

```python
@staticmethod
def __validate_something(form, field):
    if field: # Check something about the field
        raise ValidationError("Error message")
```

Even if you don't use the `form` in your validator, you still need to add it. This is because of the structure of the validators wtforms uses. If you want to create a validator that relies on a different field (say, validating an end date is after the start date) you need to have access to the start date through the `forms` argument.

```python
year = IntegerField("Year", [DataRequired(), __validate_year])
```

Also, when you add the validator to the list of validators, you do not add `()` after it. The reason is the form is validated later in the code, not on that exact line, so you simply want to pass the function into the list where it is called later. The other classes that you import and use as validators like `DataRequired` actually return a function that is then called later at the line `form.validate_on_submit()`.

```python
@staticmethod
def __validate_rating(form, field):
    rating = field.data
    if rating < 0.0 or rating > 10.0:
        raise ValidationError("Rating must be between 0.0 and 10.0")
    field.data = round(rating, 1)
```

Another thing to note here is that you can manipulate the form field without returning it. Once the entry passes validation, the float is rounded to the 10ths place before being passed to the database.

It's also of course very important to limit the number of characters each field can accept to prevent unnecessarily overloading the database.

```python
class MovieForm(FlaskForm):
    @staticmethod
    def __validate_year(form, field):
        current_year = datetime.now().year
        year = field.data
        if year < 1888 or year > current_year:
            raise ValidationError(
                f"Invalid year: {year}. Must be between 1888 and {current_year}"
            )

    @staticmethod
    def __validate_rating(form, field):
        rating = field.data
        if rating < 0.0 or rating > 10.0:
            raise ValidationError("Rating must be between 0.0 and 10.0")
        field.data = round(rating, 1)

    @staticmethod
    def __validate_ranking(form, field):
        ranking = field.data
        rankings = get_rankings()
        if ranking in rankings:
            raise ValidationError("Ranking must be unique.")
        if ranking < 1 or ranking > 10:
            raise ValidationError("Ranking must be between 1 and 10.")

    title = StringField("Title", [DataRequired(), Length(max=100)])
    year = IntegerField("Year", [DataRequired(), __validate_year])
    description = StringField("Description", [DataRequired(), Length(max=250)])
    rating = DecimalField("Rating", [DataRequired(), __validate_rating])
    ranking = IntegerField("Ranking", [DataRequired(), __validate_ranking])
    review = StringField("Review", [DataRequired(), Length(max=250)])
    img_url = StringField("Image URL", [DataRequired()])
    submit = SubmitField("Submit")
```

### `staticmethod` Decorator

Static methods are methods that belong to the class itself and not any instances of the class. Within a static method, you can't use the `self.some_variable` notation.

Static method provide some minor performance boosts, but they're largely a logical designation to note that these methods don't depend on any particular instance's data to function.

### Getting one column

In the above validation, I needed to grab all the other movies that have been ranked to make sure that you're not assigning a rank that has already been assigned to another. It's not the ideal way to do a ranking system, of course, but for this purpose it's ok.

```python
def get_rankings():
    rankings = db.session.query(Movie.ranking).scalars().all()
    return rankings
```

You can get all of the items from one column in a list using this method.
