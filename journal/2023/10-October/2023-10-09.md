## RESTful APIs

Today I'm making my first API woo! We're working with a starter project that includes a database of cafes.

### GET Random Cafe

This example below is a `GET` request for a random cafe from the database.

```python
@app.route("/random", methods=["GET"])
def random():
    num_cafes = db.session.query(Cafe).count()
    rand_id = randint(1, num_cafes)
    cafe = db.session.query(Cafe).get(rand_id)
    return jsonify(
        id=cafe.id,
        name=cafe.name,
        map_url=cafe.map_url,
        img_url=cafe.img_url,
        location=cafe.location,
        has_socket=cafe.has_sockets,
        has_toilet=cafe.has_toilet,
        has_wifi=cafe.has_wifi,
        can_take_calls=cafe.can_take_calls,
        seats=cafe.seats,
        coffee_price=cafe.coffee_price,
    )
```

First you have to count the number of cafes so you know how to set the upper limit of the random number generator.

Then, after generating a random id number, you just use that in a `.get()` request from your database and return the cafe object.

Once you have the cafe object, you can use `jsonify()` to create a nice JSON response with appropriate keys to match the data.

Another way to do this, especially if you have many different columns is to return them programmatically with a `to_dict` class method.

```python
def to_dict(self):
    return {
        column.name: getattr(self, column.name) for column in self.__table__.columns
    }
```

This dictionary comprehension iterates over the columns of the SQLAlchemy model, using the column names as keys and their corresponding attribute values as values. The `self.__table__.columns` syntax accesses the columns attribute of the SQLAlchemy model's table. This attribute contains metadata about the table's columns, including their names, types, and other properties.

You later then call the method like this:

```python
return jsonify(cafe=cafe.to_dict())
```

If you wanted to make a more elaborate form (say, returning all of the amenities grouped as such into a subdictionary), you could do that like this:

```python
def to_dict(self):
    info = {
        column.name: getattr(self, column.name)
        for i, column in enumerate(self.__table__.columns)
        if i <= 4
    }
    amenities = {
        column.name: getattr(self, column.name)
        for i, column in enumerate(self.__table__.columns)
        if i > 4
    }
    info["amenities"] = amenities
    return info
```

In this example, the amenities are all of the columns 5 and beyond, so we can split the dictionary comprehension into to processes using `enumerate()` to keep track of the index as we iterate over them, then combine them in the `info["amenities"] = amenities` line simply adding the dictionary as a new `key:value` pair.

The data this produces looks like this:

```json
{
  "cafe": {
    "amenities": {
      "can_take_calls": false,
      "coffee_price": "\u00a32.60",
      "has_sockets": false,
      "has_toilet": true,
      "has_wifi": true,
      "seats": "20-30"
    },
    "id": 15,
    "img_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOL6jxxpE_D3YS-Zzih61DqNXJKvRIDFiP6ieUI=s0",
    "location": "Clerkenwell",
    "map_url": "https://goo.gl/maps/mwAG272nQwSUc9bn8",
    "name": "The Slaughtered Lamb"
  }
}
```

In order to get the `coffee_price` pound symbol to print correctly I needed to add this code:

```python
return Response(
    json.dumps({"cafe": cafe.to_dict()}, ensure_ascii=False),
    content_type="application/json; charset=utf-8",
)
```

Further, if it matters what order the JSON is in when you return it (for a nicer developer experience), you can ensure that the dictionaries are ordered in exactly the way you want them to be with `from collections import OrderedDict` and using it like so:

```python
def to_dict(self):
    info = OrderedDict()
    amenities = OrderedDict()

    columns = list(self.__table__.columns)

    for i, column in enumerate(columns):
        column_name = column.name
        column_value = getattr(self, column.name)

        if i <= 4:
            info[column_name] = column_value
        else:
            amenities[column_name] = column_value

    info["amenities"] = amenities

    return info
```

### GET All Cafes

To get all cafes, it's pretty simple.

```python
def cafe_list_to_response(cafes):
    cafes_dict = {cafe.id: cafe.to_dict() for cafe in cafes}
    return Response(json.dumps({"cafes": cafes_dict}), content_type="application/json")

@app.route("/all", methods=["GET"])
def all():
    cafes = db.session.query(Cafe).all()
    return cafe_list_to_response(cafes)
```

Our route queries all the rows in the cafe table and returns them as a list of objects. Then, we use a separate function to transform the list of objects into a Flask response (which includes HTML headers) by doing a dictionary comprehension using the same `cafe.to_dict()` function from earlier to properly transform and nest the information. Then all we do is return the dictionary as a key of the `"cafe"` value using `json.dumps()` (which maintains the order of keys and values whereas it seems jsonify does not), and set the `content_type` to `"application/json"` so that it displays correctly in the browser.

### GET Search for Cafes

This method allows you to search for cafes based on a `location` parameter.

```python
@app.route("/search", methods=["GET"])
def search():
    location = request.args.get("location")
    if not location:
        return json.dumps({"error": "location parameter missing"}), 400
    cafes = db.session.query(Cafe).filter_by(location=location.title()).all()
    if not cafes:
        return json.dumps({"error": "No cafes found at this location"}), 404
    return cafe_list_to_response(cafes)
```

To get the parameters from the URL that come after the question mark in `/search?` you use `request.args.get("parameter")`, which in this case is `location`.

We first check if `location` is provided, and if it's not, we throw an `400` error which is a bad request.

If the `location` is provided, then query the Cafe table and filter by location (transformed to title case so it matches), and get all the objects that match.

If there are no items in `cafes`, then that means there isn't one at the provided location, so we throw a `404` error.

Finally, we put the `cafes` list through the same transform function that returns a Flask response from a list of `cafe` objects.

## Intro Next.js 1

I just had to take a break from doing these Python lessons so I'm diving into the Next.js documentation.

Next.js is a React framework that basically puts guardrails on React and packages it with extra tools to make the development process more streamlined.

If you're already using React, you can incrementally adopt Next.js. I'm learning it from the ground up so let's dive in!

**DOM** - Document Object Model. An object representation of the HTML elements.
