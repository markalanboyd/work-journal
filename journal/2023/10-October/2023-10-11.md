## DELETE Cafe

A DELETE method isn't much different than the others.

```python
@app.route("/delete/<int:cafe_id>", methods=["DELETE"])
def delete_cafe(cafe_id):
    api_key = request.args.get("api-key")
    if api_key != SECRET_API_KEY:
        return jsonify(
            error={
                "error": "Sorry, that's not allowed. Make sure you have the correct api_key"
            }
        )
    cafe = db.get_or_404(Cafe, cafe_id)
    if not cafe:
        return jsonify(
            error={
                "Not Found": "Sorry a cafe with that id was not found in the database."
            }
        )
    db.session.delete(cafe)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify(response={f"{cafe_id}": "Succesfully deleted"})
```

In this example you want to make sure you have a `SECRET_API_KEY` that only allows administrators to delete entries in your database.
